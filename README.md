# Hi there 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and keyboard smasher 😶

I specialize in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** (I have insecurities),  
debugging crises (I debug 10× more than I actually code. Terrible!!!)

Anyway, check out my **Tech Stack** below ⤵️

## 👨‍💻 TECH STACK  
_aka how I fool people into thinking I know stuff_

- **Frontend:**  
  - React (when hooks behave)  
  - CSS (I hate media queries so I just learnt Tailwind)

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js  
  - Express (for expressing my pain)  
  - PHP (old but I think it's still Gold)

- **Database:**  
  - PostgreSQL (I JOIN tables like I JOIN bad decisions)  
  - MongoDB (for when I forget what structure means)

## 🔭 Currently Debugging

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
`git reset --hard` more relationships than repositories (Maybe I am toxic)

## 📜 Famous Last Words

> "It works on my machine"  
> "I will fix it later" _(Spoiler: I won’t)_  
> "This is just a quick fix" _(Entire codebase collapses)_  
> "It’s not a bug, it’s a feature"
